							<h2>The Effectiveness Framework</h2>
							<p style="margin-bottom: 4px;">A framework based on Peter Drucker's book "The Effective Executive"</p>
							<i>May 26, 2017</i>

								<p>When plumbing the depths of management reading lists, suggested articles, and lauded recommendations, it is impossible not to pick up at least some of Peter Drucker's work. A luminary of the management profession, Drucker's work is central to how much of the world approaches business today. This post reflects upon his book <i>The Effective Executive</i> and builds from it a framework to analyze characters in my ongoing series <i>The Business of Culture</i>.</p>

								<p>I chose this book and framework as my first because they lend themselves well to character analysis. When I was curating cultural works to examine, the immediate availability of characters to analyze far outstripped those of organizations I encountered. While I intend to source, examine, and discuss organizations in cultural works, individual character analysis proved a more appropriate vehicle to test the initial hypothesis of the project; "business lessons can be made more interesting by leveraging film, literature, and culture". The pivot in the middle of the week meant that I didn't complete a full character analysis by today, but to make up for lost time I'll be releasing a comparative analysis of two characters within this framework next Friday.</p>

								<p>This framework does not exclusively evaluate executives as they are commonly referred to. Instead, Drucker defines executives as "those knowledge workers, managers, or individual professionals who are expected by virtue of their position or their knowledge to make decisions in the normal course of their work that have significant impact on the performance and results of the whole," (pg 8). Knowledge workers are present at most levels of the modern organization, and their share of labor in organizations is only likely to increase as software, machine learning, and automation continue to eat the world. It is our collective responsibility then, to ensure that we equip knowledge workers and the modern executive with the appropriate preparation to be effective in their roles.</p>

								<p>The five points of the Effectiveness Framework are below.</p>

								<h3>1: Time Management</h3>
								<p>Time is the only truly scare resource. Knowing this, effective executives begin with managing time, not tasks. Recording time, culling wasted time, systematically managing time, and consolidating time are the actions to evaluate successful time management. </p>

								<h3>2: Focus on Contribution and Results</h3>
								<p>Effective executives know that their work begins and ends with their contribution to the organization. To be healthy, organizations need direct results, built and reaffirmed values, and the development of people for the organization's challenges of tomorrow.</p>

								<h3>3: Managing Around Strengths</h3>
								<p>Making strengths productive requires managing around the strengths of your knowledge workers, building positions that are objective and well-defined, and finding employees "good for the task."</p>

								<h3>4: Concentration and Orientation...</h3>
								<p><i>...where Superior Performance Yields Outstanding Results.</i></p>

								<h3>5: Effective Decisions</h3>
								<p></p>
